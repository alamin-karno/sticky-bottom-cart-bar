# This file is intentionally kept blank.
# It's used to ensure that the 'languages' directory is tracked by Git,
# as Git does not track empty directories.
# This directory is intended to store .po and .mo translation files
# for the Sticky Bottom Cart Bar plugin.
#
# The Text Domain for this plugin is: sticky-bottom-cart-bar
# The Domain Path is: /languages
#
# A .pot (Portable Object Template) file can be generated using tools like
# WP-CLI: wp i18n make-pot . languages/sticky-bottom-cart-bar.pot
# or other Poedit-compatible software.
#
# This .pot file would then be used by translators to create .po files
# for specific languages (e.g., sticky-bottom-cart-bar-fr_FR.po),
# which are then compiled into .mo files (e.g., sticky-bottom-cart-bar-fr_FR.mo).
